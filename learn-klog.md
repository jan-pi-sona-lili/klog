# klog

### what is klog?
"klog" is a family of conlangs made (currently) by jan pi sona lili (me). While each conlang under it has slightly different minor goals, the overarching goal is the same: **to have as many words as possible defined in klog itself**, building up from "base" words. (If this sounds similar to the programming language Forth, you are not mistaken.)

#### phono/orthography, syllable structure
See [this file](https://github.com/jan-pi-sona-lili/klog/blob/main/phono-ortho-syllable.md) for the main klog phonology.
For other klogs, see their respective `phono-ortho-syllable.md` files.
