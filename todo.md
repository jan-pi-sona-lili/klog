### new words
```
- word types 
  x1 is a list
  x1 is a particle
  x1 is an argument

- adjectives
  x1 is sequencial or ordered
  x1 is this/that

- words mostly for definitions
 x1 is an opener for x2
   -- x1 is a closer for x2 (using the opposite particle)
 x1 is a new word with the list x2 as the definition


p. makes the next word the opposite of itself
p. negates the next word
p. (when the next word closes a thing) used to turn the normal closing (it only closes the most recently opened one) into a closing for all open of that thing. for example, you can close every open supercontext with [this particle] [supercontext closer]
]
