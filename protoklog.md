(forgot to add this until now; the dates will look weird)

protoklog is the first draft of klog. the most notable differences from modern klog were: vowels were similar to laiqbun's vowels in that they were representative of the word type (`a` was for nouns, `i` for predicates, and `o` for relative clauses); the other difference being that the syllable structure was `CV(N)`. Its (unfinished, as it got scrapped) base words were:
```
fi = x1 is in a quantity of 0; si = x1 is in a quantity of 1; zi = x1 ... 2; pi = x1 ... 3; ki = x1 ... 4; li = x1 ... 5
fli = x1 is a new word
sli = x1 is an argument
zli = x1 is a supercontext
pli = current supercontext ender
kli = x1 is the x2th argument
lli = ends all supercontexts
```
As this version got scrapped minutes after being created, there's really not much else to say about it.
